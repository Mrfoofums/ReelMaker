Welcome back to Podcast Air, where we let air run the show. My name's Jason. I'm a filmmaker. I'm forest trade and stuff. And I have no idea how those two career paths line up, but here we are. Yeah. So what are we getting into today? Today we're going to talk about anti anti-woke. What it means to be woke.

00:00:30:10 - 00:00:44:04
Unknown
What is the Anti-woke movement and what does it mean to be anti anti-woke? Or what? I just thought of as mega woke. Oh, shit. Have you. Have you heard about this movie?

00:00:44:06 - 00:01:08:04
Unknown
There's a whole party like the woke thing, right? So there's this movie that just came out. It's like a semi horror, like Thriller movie called Nefarious. We heard of it. So it's about this guy that commits like this, these string of murders. And then he's on death row and they send like a psychiatrist to go and evaluate him to see if he's eligible for execution.

00:01:08:05 - 00:01:34:22
Unknown
Basically. Okay. And then the whole movie is just an interview between the psychiatrist and the murderer who is possessed by a demon. So it's psychiatrists talking to the demon. And the demon is basically going on about like, you know, how demons operate and how the world is like sinking into darkness or whatever. And the first half of. First of all, the acting fantastic.

00:01:35:00 - 00:02:00:11
Unknown
But the first half of the movie, it grips you. You're like, Oh, I'm in here because acting is really good and the script is really good. And then it takes a very far right turn where the demon starts going off about abortion, this and fucking and it just turns into this like right wing, like propaganda farm. And like, I was so taken aback and I'm watching it and I'm like, Damn, this is good as fuck.

00:02:00:15 - 00:02:25:03
Unknown
Yeah. And then it takes that right turn and I'm like, Damn, I'm killing too many babies. I'm still hella entertained. Yeah, that's crazy. So I was like, Damn, I don't agree. However, you're making a very convincing argument based on like, how well this movie's acted, but certainly how propaganda works, you know, just like presents a rational idea has been is right.

00:02:25:03 - 00:03:02:18
Unknown
But it's like the one plus one kind of equals two. Then they package it up into a film you know. Mhm. And that's, that's how they get you. You know whenever I, whenever I decide to post like a short for this I'm going to throw up the part of the film where the demon like. So the psychiatrist's wife is actively having an abortion while they're in the room together and the demon gets up and he's like, your unborn son is on our altar in 3 to 1 and like, it's actually happening while the demon is saying it, but he shouldn't know any of this information.

00:03:02:18 - 00:03:25:22
Unknown
It's bad entertaining. I was while I was like, Oh shit, how does he know that is wild? But at the same time I was just like, Dog is reminds me of his wife. Shows that, like, that's her body, her choice. Like, yeah, this is where I may have a Louis C.K. bit I saw ticktock of yesterday where he's like, We used to just accept that like the weak babies would die, you know, is just like him.

00:03:25:22 - 00:03:47:22
Unknown
A guy used to only be the good babies then, like in the past, like 50 years, we just started saving all the babies, which is a little bit different than, like, abortion, but it's just like it used to be accepted that just like, motherfuckers would die, you know, like if you if you came out and, you know, you had respiratory problems or something and we didn't have modern medicine, you just die, Then they would literally just have another kid.

00:03:48:00 - 00:04:08:20
Unknown
Like using up that one wasn't good enough. Or like, you're so sad, but you're like, Yeah, people dying was like, uh, are losing babies. I would say. I would say people. Obviously, I think if something is born, it's success. It's life is loss. But there was just like this general understanding that like, you know, a baby is like the beginning of life.

00:04:08:20 - 00:04:33:05
Unknown
It's not like a whole person. You got to have been on a ship about, you know, uh, very, very different. Yeah. Yeah. So the only the only I don't even have pushback on that. It's just like I feel like we used to be a very, you know, nature says survival of the fittest, right? And we kind of came in and we're like, you know what?

00:04:33:05 - 00:04:54:01
Unknown
Not survival of everybody. Yeah, keep it, keep it. Breathe in. Survival is of as much as is physically possible. And it's like, all right, the whole the whole thing is a moral gray area no matter how you cut it. Because even people who are alive, like people who are on their deathbed, you know, like the right to you know, I can remember they call it like that's another part of the fucking movie.

00:04:54:03 - 00:05:24:08
Unknown
So shit. So the the demon in the movie or whatever, he, he, he tells a psychiatrist, he's like, you're going to commit three murders before you leave this room today. One obviously being like committing the inmate or the demon himself to be executed to being the abortion. And then three, he goes into this thing of like how the psychiatrist mother like this long before the psychiatrist ever walked in the building.

00:05:24:08 - 00:05:48:23
Unknown
But his mother was on like, assisted living and like she was basically on her deathbed and asked for and she requested euthanasia. How was that? But like the demon tries to like, phrase it as like murder, and it's like, nah, here's here's a part of it. So that's like, that's what I'm saying, though. Like, this movie is so, like, so propaganda.

00:05:48:23 - 00:06:16:04
Unknown
E Yeah, that I was like, it lost me and I was like, Damn, I was rooting. I was rooting for this movie so good. But then it just, yeah, and the thing about is like, this is going to be a political episode, I guess is like, say you're doing it for religious purposes. If the mom and the baby die and they just go to whatever afterlife they're going to go to anyways, you know, like what's, what's the big deal?

00:06:16:06 - 00:06:39:19
Unknown
Yeah, if you believe in heaven, then baby's fucking in heaven. Like, who gives a fuck? You know, it doesn't add up because it doesn't add up. You know that. That's not the reason. The reason is always control. It's always about controlling. You know, other people can and can't do. Which brings us back to the whole like, woke agenda thing, which I can't stand.

00:06:39:19 - 00:07:06:12
Unknown
What the word woke has like come to mean in like the modern day or whatever it is. It's like people so woke came up in like the 1960s as a term used pretty much exclusively by people of color to basically just they say like yo there's fuckery about yes they woke up. Stay alert. Keep your head up head up, keep head on.

00:07:06:12 - 00:07:28:21
Unknown
So you know there's sundown town about six miles down the street. Stay woke. Yes. No, no. What's going on over there? If you don't know what a sundown town is, By the way, that's a town where don't be black after the sun goes down. All right? It's. And they still exist. Yeah, Which is. Which is fucking insane. Yeah, that's insane to me.

00:07:28:23 - 00:07:53:12
Unknown
Like, that's still the thing, cause I got a. I got a cousin who's a truck driver. He's like, I'm not allowed to stop, like, pretty much anywhere in Mississippi. That's wild. Fucked up. That's absolutely fucked up. That's the world we live in, folks. Racism. But what is woke me now, according to the people who hate it. Really? The people that hate black people.

00:07:53:16 - 00:08:28:08
Unknown
But I feel like woke is like diet nigger. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit the hard r there, but had to do it. Had to do it to them anyway. The people that use the word woke now use it to describe anything. Pro progress. Yeah. Anything pro like any progressive outlook or liberal outlook on the way that we view the world like inclusion is woke right any sort.

00:08:28:13 - 00:08:55:03
Unknown
It is a whole other annoying thing because now woke is wrapped up in like gay rights and like LGBT ends. Like it's like that's not what it is like being woke is being woke is just being aware of history and the systems that place and just be aware of you know, what's really going on in the world because you can to be the antithesis of being woke would to be just it's a state of ignorance, right?

00:08:55:04 - 00:09:19:11
Unknown
Of just like none of that shit affects me. So I'm so being woke isn't even like a progressive stance. It's not really saying, you know, I've been trying to change people ideas. Being woke is a defensive stance. Basically you're saying, Hey, you know, we live in a unjust world in society, so stay woke so that like you don't get unjustly arrested or prosecuted for whatever it is, whatever minority group you are.

00:09:19:11 - 00:09:45:18
Unknown
And I guess what being woke is like. It's funny that like they turn being woke into like an agenda because being woke isn't an agenda because there is there is a progressive like agenda or agendas of people who want to, like, make the world more accepting for you, not only just black people, but, you know, every minority group as well as, you know, both racially and, you know, whatever your sexual orientation is, that exists.

00:09:45:18 - 00:10:11:23
Unknown
But staying woke is like a defensive stance of like, yo, you're in a you're in an unsafe space. Stay woke. It's not safe here. You know, I'm saying, like, that's all exact. And so like, even on even on the on the subject of like sexuality. Right. Like we live in Florida, obviously there's like a huge thing on like transgender rights, even gay rights here in the state of Florida.

00:10:12:01 - 00:10:53:06
Unknown
And the way that it's looked at is that like, oh, if we teach if we teach anything about sexual orientation to our kids in their formative years, then their argument is that it either it increases the likelihood that they will turn out to be gay or whatever the case may be, or it's like you're overly pushing sexuality onto children and I have an analogy for the way that I view it, which is obviously opposed to that ideology, but it's kind of like it's kind of like a lighthouse, right?

00:10:53:08 - 00:11:38:08
Unknown
Whereas when you put up a gay flag, a transgender flag, it's a symbol for like if your kid is born gay or transgender or whatever the case may be, whatever their sexual orientation may be, they were born that way. Like, that's just how they came out. Luck of the draw, but. Right. And so having inclusivity in the school curriculum, in whatever the case may be, having the flags up is kind of like a lighthouse in that it's saying, Hey, this thing that you feel is real and exists and if you feel this way like it's okay and there is a community out here to support you.

00:11:38:10 - 00:12:09:16
Unknown
So it's basically like a lighthouse in the dark. Like when you come out and you start to feel like, Oh, I'm not like everybody else. It's like, Oh shit. And most people, their first reaction is going to be self isolate. Yeah, as an antithesis to that. When you shine a light on those issues and when you shine a light on the topic of sexuality, especially at a young age where they're just starting to realize like, Hey, I might be a little different from everybody out here.

00:12:09:18 - 00:12:35:17
Unknown
So when you're able to shine a light on it, it's not making them gay. It's just giving them an opportunity to say, Oh shit, that's what I am. Okay, Yeah. And then they can, you know, move in the direction of being more true to themselves. So it's like sexuality in school curriculum is not making your kid gay. Your kid was already gay, right?

00:12:35:17 - 00:13:00:12
Unknown
Like the idea that I'm just going to be explicit because it's our fucking podcast, like, say what I want, but really, for the sake of example, like you either want to be around dicks or you don't want to be around dicks. Like I'm telling you guys, like, it doesn't mean sexuality is a spectrum. So like, maybe, you know, you want X amount of dicks, you favor women more than cocks, right?

00:13:00:14 - 00:13:28:00
Unknown
But you can't fucking sit me down and, like, fucking convince me to go suck addict. You know, at any age, there's no, there's no amount of convincing. Like if I was eight years old and someone was like any pause. But, you know, it's just so much fun and I don't even want to try it. And I'm like, Well, I've just known since all ten years of my life that like, is and I'm pretty sure I don't like dicks.

00:13:28:01 - 00:13:53:07
Unknown
And because I've had that experience, I know that people have similar but differing experiences where either it's the opposite or they are they're cool with all of it. But like, there's like you ever been hit on by a gay did? Yeah, all the time. Yeah. Isn't it flattering as fuck it is. It's because like first of all, as men, like getting hit on by women is not is can be a rare occurrence.

00:13:53:07 - 00:14:13:09
Unknown
If you're like, extremely good, good looking, then the little girl or the girl hits on you like makes your day when a girl listen. I remember everything that a woman has ever given me in my entire life. Gay dude hits on you. It's first. It's funny because you're like, Oh, you think I play for that team? But it's like, Yeah, no, I don't, but thank you.

00:14:13:11 - 00:14:46:20
Unknown
But then it just goes away from me, you know? I don't even get I don't even get the disclaimer. I'm Jamaican. I come from the most homophobic community of people to ever exist. Like Jamaicans don't don't play that shit. I was like, But that's never been a part of my reality growing up. Like I've lived. I've always lived as a part of a very tolerant and accepting community like no one in my immediate family or in my immediate scope of friends within the Jamaican community has ever been like hyper homophobic.

00:14:46:20 - 00:15:11:23
Unknown
But it is a part of our culture where it's like, I guess it's more of a Rastafarian thing where like Rastafarianism is very, very heavily opposed to that. And like, I'm not a Rasta, none of my family are Rastas. So that's just how that goes. But so this one, there's one time I had a gay do him on me at a bar, and I was just like, Oh, sorry, play.

00:15:11:23 - 00:15:34:03
Unknown
I don't, I don't swing for that team. Yeah. And his, his approach was to just like, befriend me and that he was buying me drinks all night. And I was like, I see your play, brother. It's not going to work. I run the same play, man. And so listen, I'm the quarterback of that team, brother. You know, you can't run this play on me right?

00:15:34:05 - 00:15:59:07
Unknown
But I was accepting the drinks, so I was like, Am I leading him on? Right? No, I'm just accepting drinks from a stranger. That's what of the situation to talk to. Dude is a brother like of straight, you know, He's like, Oh, cool. Whatever. He's drinking and hanging out and then like, but there's still kind of flirting is like, I kind of feel gay right out because I definitely already straight up said this and like it outright.

00:15:59:07 - 00:16:22:12
Unknown
I have like adorable like the conversation but there's still like, fuck it, be it all just gay. Yeah, yeah. Just like, like bro, like I'm I'm a remind you that let me the reminder phase right and a reminder phase in the in that whole scenario is fucking hilarious was like the reminder phase is like you're probably like what, four drinks in here?

00:16:22:12 - 00:16:42:19
Unknown
Like a by the way, I'm just putting this out there. This that you think is happening is not happening. I just want to reiterate for all parties involved because you probably people like a group of people. It's not just if it's just YouTube. There's one dude on TikTok that did this like comedy bit about like he went on a gay date, but he had no idea it was a date.

00:16:42:22 - 00:17:04:03
Unknown
Yeah, basketball dude is hilarious. I'll put the clip up and I find it, but it's like if you're if you're one on one completely different scenario that happened to me. I forgot it was when I first moved here. Bro. Welcome. So I'm talking to you. I thought I told Brian about this. Thought it was. It was hilarious. Bro is.

00:17:04:03 - 00:17:23:14
Unknown
I can't remember where I met this dude. He's a real estate agent. I invest in real estate. Right? So he's talk. We exchanged numbers, all that. Just talking about real estate, bro. Talking about business somewhere. Fucking miscommunication. Communication at some level got missed because he was like, Yo, there's grab coffee, we'll meet up, I'll talk business, whatever. I'm like, word.

00:17:23:14 - 00:17:44:17
Unknown
That's like a normal thing to communicate, people do. So I showed the coffee and I'm like, Yo, like the way this guy's looking at me. Yeah, well, I may be a little too excited to see me. So it's like, that's lesson plan. My eyes are up here. What's he doing in Down? And he's asking me, like, date questions.

00:17:44:19 - 00:18:05:00
Unknown
And at first I'm like, Maybe he's just like, there's, Look, I'm in sales. So I've actually met like, a ton of, like, weird people. And one of the things when you meet somebody who, like, breaks your social expectations is I'm always open to just like, not react immediately. I'm like, okay, this person is they could be from different background of a part of the world.

00:18:05:00 - 00:18:22:15
Unknown
I have no idea what is actually normal for them. Also, I'm new to Miami, so I post the conversation very openly to see what it was. But then after like two or three questions, I was like, Oh, this man is gay. Like, this is actually where this is going. And so then I just, I just had to like explicitly say it.

00:18:22:15 - 00:18:41:16
Unknown
So I just like, started adding hints that like, because you can't do that, you can say you can't just come out and be like, Are you gay? Yeah, because the pretext for the conversation was talking them up. Honestly, that's that's actually the direct approach is actually a hilarious way to go about it. Like, yo, you coming on to me right now?

00:18:41:18 - 00:19:11:00
Unknown
You know me, bro. Yeah. Honestly, that, like, kind of diffuses the tension for me at least, cause. Yeah, but I feel like people who are what's the word homophobic is going to say anti-gay. Anti-gay. I can think of the word homophobia. I think people who are homophobic are afraid of those situations so much. Yeah. Like they're afraid of like being hit on by a guy and like, the act like, like if it got its own use in some way, it's going to start fucking you.

00:19:11:05 - 00:19:34:07
Unknown
It takes away from your masculinity or like, what? You think I'm not a man, so you could just fuck me and it's like, Nah, dude, that's just that's literally just a mirror. Like, that's just you. Like when you go out and talk to women, he's doing the same fucking thing that you do. And it is weird. I will say it's weird, especially when it first happens to you, but eventually you realize like, is this just a normal thing?

00:19:34:07 - 00:20:07:02
Unknown
I will. I'm going to touch on one thing real quick, which is there's a there's sort of a subculture among I don't know if this is necessarily something that happens among women, but among gay men, I'm sure it happens among women, man. In fact, I'm positive. But there's like a subculture of gay men who just thoroughly enjoy trying to get straight men or maybe even gay or be curious men to like they like to, like, turn out guys.

00:20:07:04 - 00:20:30:12
Unknown
Yeah. And a whole lot of gray areas around that because that's I think that's a little weird as to where you have to ask the question if they successfully turn out. I mean, those dudes probably just had repressed gayness and those guys were just good at finding those dudes. You know, I'm saying they can sniff them out like truffle hound.

00:20:30:12 - 00:20:52:19
Unknown
It's like I'm saying, like, you're either down and it's repressed due to the society that we live in. Yeah, it's hetero focused, right. And so it would be easy, like, say, if you're a bi person and our generation specifically where we grew up just being gay as a slew, like straight up like millennials, like we were very homophobic generation as children.

00:20:52:21 - 00:21:28:20
Unknown
Oh sure. Which is why I think we have the backlash now as a whole. I have this whole theory about this. I won't go back to this. But yeah, so like, I think it's definitely wrong to like, push past, like initial, like, hey, I'm like, I'm not about that. But somebody eventually, I mean, and it's just like, no means no my just been made because then we get into like coercion and it's that's why I say there's a shit ton of gray areas around that because it's like life is all gray, though, you know, like there's nothing is black and white.

00:21:28:20 - 00:21:54:18
Unknown
Everything's gray. But damn, we fucking went off on a tangent. Yeah. What happened to Easy? But the stuff that we were talking about. Well, but what I think this fits in because what we described is a very progressive stance, which I mean to be, to be fair, like that accepted and stuff is I think what very conservative people are afraid of.

00:21:54:19 - 00:22:10:21
Unknown
They don't want to live in that world where guys can guys can hit on them and they have to navigate it, right? They don't want that because they want gays to be over here. Don't don't talk to me. You can exist. Like their idea of acceptance is like, oh, yeah, we it's gay people just don't ask me out, Don't interact with me.

00:22:10:22 - 00:22:34:04
Unknown
I don't wanna have to think about my sexuality ever my being confronted with it. I just want to, you know, like that's I don't want to I don't want to have to think about my sexuality ever. Yeah. I've decided on what it is, and I'm not doing any more work on that. Right. And like, that's really what it is, right?

00:22:34:04 - 00:22:55:02
Unknown
Which is like, it goes, it goes into pretty much every conservative ideology, which is like, I don't want to have to think about it. I don't either think I don't want to have to think about my relationship with black people. So here are the rules on black people. That's what it is. Go away, my conservative friends. Watch this.

00:22:55:02 - 00:23:12:08
Unknown
I love you. Well, I would say most of my friends are conservative. So it's not an attack. It's not. This is just by hatred of you. They'll get it. So, you know, they'll joke. You can flavor. Look, I have my own conservative friends. Julian, if you're watching this, you're my only conservative friend. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm getting it.

00:23:12:10 - 00:23:36:18
Unknown
But yeah, it kind of goes back to just like I want like, it's like I want life to be to play by simple rules. Yeah. And like, when shit starts turning, when everything starts turning gray. And, like, I got to really start thinking about every little. That's a I'm an overthinker. I hate that. I don't like to have to overthink.

00:23:36:18 - 00:24:05:10
Unknown
So being against having to think so much, not necessarily such a bad thing. I get it. Yeah. I don't like thinking like too much about every single interaction. I'm just more of a like I'm a tolerant and reactive person, which is like I can tolerate any situation that you put me in. I even just tolerate like I can navigate through any situation that you put me in and, you know, I'm not nothing's really going to like shake me to my core.

00:24:05:11 - 00:24:32:06
Unknown
Like if gay dude hits on me, I'm just like, Oh shit, Gay do thinks I'm attractive. He also probably thinks I'm gay. I wonder why that is. Am I wearing something particularly gay anyway? And then. And then I just go about my business, you know what I mean? I don't give that much thought, which is like an overthink, like a super overthinking person, which I consider myself as even still, but a super overthinking person will start questioning everything about their reality in that situation.

00:24:32:06 - 00:24:55:04
Unknown
And I really am like, Why does someone else think I'm gay? I think that's a part of me that most people will spiral. That's I think that's the part that people who are very anti it are afraid of. Right? So one, there's a lot of closeted people who grew up conservative that have this reaction. And then I think there's also people who have like a toxic sense of masculinity who are like, why does he think I'm gay?

00:24:55:04 - 00:25:13:14
Unknown
Like, am I not man enough, not realizing that, like, you could present like you could be a super like, quote unquote masculine dude, I'd have to be gay. One thing that you do that looks kind of like, Hey, wait a minute. Well, no, I'm. I'm just saying, like, there you wear your hair. Could be like, you know, when you're talking with your hands, you do this a little bit.

00:25:13:14 - 00:25:34:18
Unknown
But yeah, everything everything comes back to just like everything is gray, right? And then like, well, the point I was going to make is that like, there are gay dudes you would never know are gay if you have that perception of gay people because they don't fit your idea of effeminate men. Right? They're just. They're masculine in every single way.

00:25:34:18 - 00:25:55:05
Unknown
And unless you talk to them and you their personal life, you want to know they're gay, Right? But that doesn't fit what we as a society think of of gay people. And so it's funny that, like, you have that reaction of like, oh, I think I gay, but it's like the gay person they know. They know that gay people come in different shapes, sizes and mannerisms, right?

00:25:55:09 - 00:26:17:02
Unknown
I think like you don't know that at least 2% gay, like everybody's had like a gay thought here. They're all like 8% gay. It's high. It's it's a problem. It is, though, I think I think you really hit the nail on the head, man, with like now people not wanting to think about it in like, their sexuality at all.

00:26:17:04 - 00:26:42:12
Unknown
And I think it takes direct experience to to actually know like, like having gay friends, like having, you know, because otherwise, if you have a conversation with someone and you're trying to change their mind, you're not trying to just like, you know, be right, you're trying to actually change their mind and let's assume they're homophobic. It's like the only you could do that is like relating through human experiences, which is really, really hard, unless you're really, really not.

00:26:42:12 - 00:27:10:23
Unknown
Everybody has like, I think where we get tripped up is not everybody has a wealth of life experience. Exactly. How can you explain this so blessed? I've been so blessed as to be able to experience a lot of different people from a lot of different walks of life. But certain people that grew up in certain communities where like the whole community is one way, like this whole community is a bunch of people that try to live life the same way and we all pick the place and we all live here and right.

00:27:10:23 - 00:27:32:05
Unknown
You grew up in this environment and all your neighbors are conservative and or whatever the case may be. All your neighbors are of a certain race or of a certain background, and you don't have a wealth of life experience or wealth of different kinds of people around you to even have these experiences. So how are you possibly going to be able to relate to them?

00:27:32:07 - 00:28:02:05
Unknown
Yeah, right. They don't know anything about your life because they obviously didn't grow up in that same community you did. You don't know anything about their life because you've never even been outside your community. You might as well have lived on a mormon farm where your whole life is how it is. Same problem exist for progressives too. Like I know people say like if you grew up in New York City and you've always been around like people who are bi pansexual, all these different things, then you go someone who has a different life experience, right?

00:28:02:05 - 00:28:20:18
Unknown
And your default position is I'm right and they're wrong, and their default position is I'm right and you're wrong. Like because you haven't actually thought about what it's like to grow up in a more homogenous place, It's going to be really, really hard for you to relate to that person again if your goal is to change their mind.

00:28:20:19 - 00:28:36:16
Unknown
Right? I think a lot of people want the conversations with just like I want this person to know that they're wrong and I hate them, but like I want everyone to see it like that. So that's how they approach that conversation is at anybody's goal though. Like, why are you trying to change other people's minds when you are?

00:28:36:17 - 00:28:59:06
Unknown
You don't even have your own mind made up like and your mind shouldn't ever be made up because there's the whole concept of and I'm just going to keep using that term. Your mind being made up. Your mind should be ever changing. Yeah. Like you, your mind should never be made up on anything. Any one piece of information could come a lot like tomorrow.

00:28:59:08 - 00:29:18:22
Unknown
Tomorrow they could find out that, Hey, you know what? We've been wrong this entire time. The Earth actually is the center of the universe, and we just found this out. And that could come out tomorrow. And that would be. And we would be like, Well, shit, I guess that whole thing was wrong. Not to create a whole new concept of reality in my head.

00:29:19:00 - 00:29:48:08
Unknown
Or tomorrow they could find out that like, Yo, fucking COVID was never real or whatever the case may be that comes out. I mean, society at its core, society would fucking crumble, fucking you torn in half. I know it would be bad. So it's just like, know your reality and reality is not fixed. Now. None of the information that you think you know that you think is a fact is fixed except like certain scientific information.

00:29:48:13 - 00:30:21:02
Unknown
And even that can change with new data and new research. Right? So like to think that your mind is made up and to think that things are I don't want to put that things are concrete in the way that they're solidified in your universe. Even the idea that you understand the world, you know, like one of the things and I actually get I understand so well, like the mindset of some of these people because I legitimate grew up thinking being gay was wrong.

00:30:21:02 - 00:30:37:11
Unknown
I was very much in the church, went to church like three times a week. And it was just my religious belief system. I'm not I don't hate it. I'm mad that that was my upbringing. It just was my life. And that is a lot of people's life, right? You are given beliefs, right? They're given to you. They're kind of thrust upon you.

00:30:37:11 - 00:30:58:22
Unknown
Right. And through experience, you know, living and having friends and probably an open minded person in general. But eventually, you know, and like a teenage probably as a teenager, I was like, this is wrong. Like, it's not good to think this way, you know? And I actually started pushing my friends that, yeah, we should stop saying stuff as gay people like flame me all the time.

00:30:58:22 - 00:31:16:22
Unknown
I was like, This is this is a long time ago. This is like a long time ago. But I was just like, I'm like, this is like early 2000s. Yeah, I was just like, I don't like that shit. I don't think that's it's wrong, you know? Then especially in college, I had gay teammates who I really, really respected, which is kind of the it seems like a cheesy way to, like, really have these realizations, but that's why I'm saying like, it takes experience.

00:31:16:22 - 00:31:34:14
Unknown
But like when I had like, men that I like really, really respected and I was going through the grind with trying to be like D-1 track athletes who were gay, that and I was like, I'm an adult at this point. That's that's when it really solidified that. Like, okay, like whatever preconceived notion I grew up with is wrong.

00:31:34:14 - 00:32:03:19
Unknown
And not everybody had that realization because I definitely had teammates in college who kind of went the other way right? And so it really takes this open mindset and understanding that like and I would say empathy to realize that, like, we're all just here and here's here's the other thing that I think I always tell the people when you confront anything with any belief system is like this person could mask and not say anything like their life would be a lot easier.

00:32:03:21 - 00:32:28:12
Unknown
They think about it, well, maybe not easier, probably painful, but outwardly, right? If you in a world that hates your sexual orientation. Right. And it's not something that shows up. Right. Being black, I can't hide being black, you know, But people many, many people have hidden their sexual orientation. Right. And so I said I lied. I've never tried to not be black.

00:32:28:16 - 00:32:57:10
Unknown
Let anybody tell you that I. I love being black. If I could be born 50 more times, I'd be born Caribbean black every single time. I'd probably try being like, what is it in Australia? The Samoan. Oh, you're talking about, you're talking about. Or then why? Yeah, I'd come back as like a really big Samoan guy. Yeah. And then the next the life out of that I go back to being black.

00:32:57:10 - 00:33:16:07
Unknown
That'd be natural, being someone with tattoos and all that shit. Yeah. Every time I try one life is like a tall white guy, but then probably just go back to being black, but it just doesn't. It was like. But anyways, like, I can remember my initial thought was about my bad. I'm sorry I you're good, but what I did, I completely lost it.

00:33:16:07 - 00:33:37:09
Unknown
I got it. Completely lost. Oh, shit. Where's my phone? The threat. It's been 34 minutes. We're 35 minutes in. I mean, you guys, you guys are near the point that I was trying to make, though, but. Yeah, man, I mean, you just. I think relating to people, which is why it's so hard. But the. Oh, yeah, here's where I was going with this, right?

00:33:37:10 - 00:33:58:04
Unknown
When you have empathy and you realize that like, you know, I was born in Bellville, you're born in wherever some small town, like the idea that you can understand the world, right in 20 odd years, 30 odd years, 40 odd years, and just have a concrete idea based off of some limited set of experiences and whatever small fucking ass town like that's what it was for me.

00:33:58:04 - 00:34:16:10
Unknown
I was like, I grew up in some small randomness town. It's unimportant, right? I barely met anybody. I haven't really done anything. I was like, There's no way I have the shit figured out. There's no way my opinions about other people are correct. And I was legitimately like my thought. And that's why I was like, And I'm very open to like anything.

00:34:16:10 - 00:34:40:10
Unknown
I know it's crazy, but like, I like people, like I believe in this. I'm like, I literally am is like, that's cool. And that's why that's why I have a lot of this drives my very political lefty friends. I have a lot of like friends. I have friends that every political ideology. But I get along really well with conservatives cause like, I just have empathy, great people on both sides of the aisle, you know, we're all the same.

00:34:40:12 - 00:34:59:10
Unknown
I don't I don't think that everybody I don't I mean, I don't make the argument that the left and right is the same. That's not what I'm saying. Like, I always I personally actually hate I'm saying this right now, but like, I've always voted left. Um, probably will. I'm just gonna say probably I could not. Who knows? But I get along with conservatives.

00:34:59:10 - 00:35:19:04
Unknown
I'm a business person. I'm an entrepreneur. Right? So like, I just get it. But that's because we're all just people like, you know, you go on a day by day basis are doing the same that most other people are doing who believe differently. And that's how I think about it. It's like, I'm going fucking target to get groceries.

00:35:19:06 - 00:35:47:12
Unknown
I'm going to, you know, the clubs on the weekends. I like going to the beach, have hobbies, like our lives are the fucking same. Yeah, that's the thing, is that like when you boil it down, like a lot of people lead very similar lives and are trying to accomplish very similar things, right? Like, and you know, one of the topics that I wanted to touch on today was like, you know, the gap in opportunity between generations, which we'll get into that in a second.

00:35:47:12 - 00:36:15:02
Unknown
But hello? Fuck your upstairs neighbors are just dropping shit on the floor. That was like, was that water right there? No, look, I'm not to look at that closer to this mobster's neighbors. Actually, the one of the leasing agents. Oh, shit. So I'm gonna go knock on her door until they shut the fuck up. Oh, shit. I lost my train of thought.

00:36:15:04 - 00:36:34:04
Unknown
Wage gap or opportunity gap between generations? The opportunity to get it. Well, all right, so, like, everybody's trying to lead the same basic life principles of, like, Yo, I just want to provide for myself. Provide for my family. Yeah. I want to live a good life and do the things that I personally like to do. Right?

00:36:34:06 - 00:36:57:18
Unknown
And there's no rulebook that tells you like, Oh, this is exactly how you should do that. So we're all just kind of trying to figure that shit out and play by whatever rules our life experience gives us, right? So I want to talk about the gap in opportunity between generations because it's like, All right, your parents. My parents, my parents are immigrants.

00:36:57:18 - 00:37:38:17
Unknown
Your parents, they're just black. Black. Well, my dad's mixed mom's black mostly. Yeah. So my parents came here from Jamaica and Canada, respectively, and like, their opportunities when they came here, like, my dad worked in the school system for a really long time, and he was probably making like at most, I think throughout the time that I was growing up, probably making at most like 40 grand at most, and providing for a family of five in a pretty crazy, decently sized like three.

00:37:38:17 - 00:38:02:18
Unknown
No. Yeah. Three bedroom house in like a decent area. Yeah. And I'm like and my mom was, my mom worked, but it was never like she never really had like something like super duper stable. So I think at most our household income in a three bedroom house providing for five people at most at any given time was like 55, 60,000.

00:38:02:20 - 00:38:34:07
Unknown
I make that now as a single person when nobody would provide for. Yeah, nobody I can't afford an apartment, like I can't afford 600 square feet of space in this fucking city. So I think where people are so right now in New York, they're striking to they're striking for rent control. Yeah, a lot of people showing up to their local state houses and such.

00:38:34:09 - 00:38:59:11
Unknown
And people are looking. People all across the country are looking for rent control. What is your position on how you lived in New York and during the time you lived there? Was it rent controlled? So there's always been a very small amount of rent control. So basically New York has a so you have 100 units in a building, three of them have to be rent controlled, right?

00:38:59:11 - 00:39:24:21
Unknown
So there's like a percentage of every building that has to be affordable. Now, it's such a small amount that it's irrelevant. And so when builders or people building things, their whole model is this around, right? These four units were not going to make as much money on. Right. But it's a really, really, really, really small amount. So everybody else, let's say 95%, whatever it is, all have free market rent.

00:39:24:23 - 00:39:49:18
Unknown
So my position on this is actually a long answer because it really deals with the free market. The problem with real estate in the country, particularly rent supply, is that it's not a free market right Um oh was the shortest way to put this. So supply supply is basically how many units there are. Then demand is how many people are looking for those.

00:39:49:18 - 00:40:17:02
Unknown
Yes, demand is complex though, because there's a there's a demand floor because people have to live somewhere. So demand demand for housing will never be zero because people are being born. And people, you know, buildings get old, people have to live places to work, rent to live, to be zero. And there's other things that affect demand. The supply side is super duper manipulated in the market.

00:40:17:04 - 00:40:35:08
Unknown
What do I mean by that? You've probably heard how in like San Francisco and all these cities that have all these housing problems, like they can't do new developments because, The cities want to keep the values of the properties high, and so they're like a shit ton of vacancies too. Yep. So there's like I said, the supply side is super manipulated.

00:40:35:09 - 00:40:56:06
Unknown
Make it make sense. All right. So you have you have in in the market today, there's a ton of vacant units which are held by the investor class. Then they limit the supply by not letting people build new housing, because if you increase the supply, prices go down and prices go down. That has a leverage effect on the values of real estate.

00:40:56:06 - 00:41:18:01
Unknown
What do I mean by that? Leverage means that, you know, in a building of 100 people, if you lose ten people, the value goes down by way more than the people who left. Right. It's like a it's a it's a lover effect. But the important part of that, there is all the different ways that they're manipulating it, Right?

00:41:18:01 - 00:41:42:08
Unknown
So on the supply side, again, there's a ton of vacancies that are being held by the investor class. Then they're not really is the fact that they're not building more housing, which would, you know, allow people to have more choices to choose from and just lower the prices overall. So even here, like they're putting up new buildings like every other fucking day, right?

00:41:42:09 - 00:42:15:14
Unknown
And that's the other side where it's it's limited, right? So it's like a club, right? So there's a lot of new buildings, but these are all like there's a handful of developers, right? So they can control the prices. So because they own all the new supply, so there's new supply, but they can set the prices. So let's say that maybe it takes a little bit longer for this building to rent, but they're not going to let the price of market rent get below whatever they want it to be, because if they lower the price in that building, they have to lower the price in all the other buildings, every other building, right?

00:42:15:16 - 00:42:45:20
Unknown
So it's super saver. It's a crazy game, right? So and then we hear things about like online, they're like, oh, well, there's a there's a supply shortage of materials and like, all this shit is fake. Guys, I'm telling you, it's fake. We have, you know, more raw material in this country than is there's there's such a surplus. It's it's all like any supply shortage, anything like it's all manufactured, which is why I go back to that word free market.

00:42:45:22 - 00:43:09:20
Unknown
The problem with a free market over time is that if you don't regulate it enough, people will start to monopolize. We know monopolies exist. They happen all the time. They happen in the past. All monopoly is, is that when the game everyone starts from zero. So say you start a fair game. Eventually there's going to be people in the game.

00:43:09:20 - 00:43:33:11
Unknown
Doesn't end right. The game never ends right. And there's imagine you come into a monopoly game right after 20 hands and there's three players and one guy owns half the board and everyone else. There's four other players who own the other half, but one player owns half the board. There's you're never going to be able to maneuver over that one.

00:43:33:11 - 00:43:53:22
Unknown
Put one player. That's the world, right? So people say it's a free market, but it's like and there's all this competition. It's like there isn't competition. There's whatever that one player says, and then people can maneuver within that. And so you have to regulate to a degree what the big players are allowed to do. The market doesn't become free anymore.

00:43:53:23 - 00:44:26:08
Unknown
Right? Um, so, you know, I think free market mechanics are useful when only when there is an exceptional amount of competition. We don't have competition. Capitalism and everything fail fall. On the face of it, really, we're like an end stage capitalism today, like across the board. But that's what, that's, that's the whole that's the whole ethos behind late stage capitalism is that in a free market with these competitive aspects, eventually somebody wins the competition.

00:44:26:10 - 00:44:48:06
Unknown
Yeah, right. And in late stage capitalism, the winners have been selected. The winners have their there. Yeah. And there's no real way to leverage yourself above the ones that have won already. Like right. And you would think like, oh well as generations change and those people die out, then the new generation can come in and change the rules.

00:44:48:06 - 00:45:24:05
Unknown
That's not how that works because they're setting up the winners have set up for their lineage, their entire every person that comes after them is going to continue that winner ship, right? So there's no real way to get over that. So essentially, I feel like the only way to a the only way to really get past that late stage capitalism is to either a reset the game of monopoly, which, yeah, is catastrophic in its own right.

00:45:24:05 - 00:45:55:06
Unknown
And there's no real like when you start looking at that the only real ways to do that are like through complex revolution and complete systemic overhaul. You either reset the game or you start a new game. Yeah, and both of those in both of those involve complete societal restructuring. Yeah. And I don't think anybody's really pushing for that.

00:45:55:08 - 00:46:19:00
Unknown
I mean, people are probably pushing for it because we're desperate. But like you talked earlier about like you come on to the monopoly board and one person owns half and then the rest of everybody else owns the other half, the one person owns 99% and the rest of everybody else owns this, Right? This this everybody else has this amount of money, Monopoly money.

00:46:19:00 - 00:46:47:17
Unknown
And that one person has this big ass amount in Monopoly money. So I'm glad that we just had that readily available on the table. This is not real Money is private money that I've known for a while. Yeah, we're not we're not flexing like that. Yeah, I think it's, it's and this monopoly analogy, imagine that the board, like the way that you could fix it is like you could actually just tense the board and just add all these UN acquired stuff like we have all this like America is mostly just empty space.

00:46:47:18 - 00:47:13:03
Unknown
Yeah, like there's so much space to build. We could build new cities, better cities. You know, the only reason, guys, it's because there's not enough money. It's not because there's not enough. It's because if we do that, the people in first place won't be in first place anymore. So the only the only time that you'll see new big changes happen is when the people who are in first place are ready to profit from it.

00:47:13:05 - 00:47:30:06
Unknown
That's it. So you're not going to see like a new futuristic city pop up somewhere unless all of the big players are the ones in on it and they're reaping 90% of the profits. You're not going to see all social changes unless yeah, the big players are the ones driving it, which is why it takes so long to change us.

00:47:30:07 - 00:48:03:16
Unknown
All right, So I'll give you an example then. Let's say, for example, huge community of people. Yes, a couple million. Yeah. Move out to some fucking bump up piece of land in the middle of nowhere. Decide to build a new city in that area, right? Yeah. And the rules are the rules of this new game in this new place that we've started, are anybody that wants to invest in this area cannot be connected to the people that are currently winning in any way, shape or form.

00:48:03:18 - 00:48:21:12
Unknown
You could try. I mean, the tribe and like obviously there are going to be ways around that, right, where like, you know, the investors who are currently in charge will just go through a third party or go through X, Y and Z to make it happen. Because once you once you have that level of money, life becomes real malleable.

00:48:21:12 - 00:48:50:04
Unknown
You can kind of just make it happen out of pretty much thin air. But if you put enough systems in place to stop that from happening, you can like it would be theoretically possible to create cities in these pretty much untapped areas where they are almost self-sustaining and are able to be controlled by the rest of the players on the board.

00:48:50:06 - 00:49:08:21
Unknown
You definitely could like we could someone could build or a group of people could go build a sustainable city. It was all like solar and run on like whatever and farm and completely self-contained. You might need one financial backer, someone who's like, has a lot of money and is also very progressive. Or you could just do pure, you know, bootstrap crowdsourcing.

00:49:08:21 - 00:49:38:08
Unknown
Yeah, just crowdsource it. It's entirely possible. And like I said, America is mostly empty. So like there's laying out there that like people could just do it. You just need, you just need enough people to go do it. And it'd be cool to see. But we are coming up on 50 minutes. Yeah. So with that, if you are thinking about joining a society of people that want to just make our own city and say fuck off to all these other cities, holla at me on Instagram at J dot Tyler dot photo.

00:49:38:10 - 00:49:57:08
Unknown
Um, well, I'll start a group chat. Where are we going to call it, uh, Forever Ville? No, no, it's a terrible name. Terrible name. What? We're going to workshop the name, but so you guys in the next episode, the Gert on that note, Deuces, deuces piece.
